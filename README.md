# New England Shelf Depolarized Electrochemical Reactor with Ocean Water

Welcome to the repository for the **New England Shelf Depolarized Electrochemical Reactor (DESER)** project. This repository is dedicated to research and data collection on the development and optimization of depolarized electrochemical reactors using ocean water, specifically focused on the New England shelf region.

## About the Project

The DESER project aims to explore and advance the application of depolarized electrochemical reactors for various environmental and industrial uses. These reactors utilize ocean water as an electrolyte to drive chemical reactions that can produce valuable products such as hydrogen, reduce CO2 emissions, and potentially aid in environmental restoration efforts.

## Goals and Objectives

- **Research and Development**: Investigate the fundamental principles and mechanisms of depolarized electrochemical reactions in ocean water.
- **Data Collection**: Gather comprehensive data on reactor performance, efficiency, and environmental impact in the New England shelf region.
- **Optimization**: Develop strategies to enhance the efficiency and sustainability of these reactors.
- **Applications**: The primary application of this project is carbon capture from ocean water. This approach not only helps in reducing atmospheric CO2 levels but also offers potential benefits such as mitigating climate change, enhancing marine ecosystem health, and providing a sustainable source of carbon for industrial processes. 

## Repository Contents

This repository will serve as a central hub for all data, research findings, and documentation related to the DESER project. While the repository is currently being set up, you can expect the following types of content to be uploaded in the near future:

- **Research Papers and Reports**: Detailed documentation of our research methodologies, experiments, and findings.
- **Data Sets**: Raw and processed data collected from various experiments and field studies.
- **Project Updates**: Regular updates on the progress of the project, including milestones and significant achievements.
- **Code and Models**: Computational models, simulations, and analysis scripts used in our research.
- **Collaborative Tools**: Resources to facilitate collaboration among researchers, including templates, guidelines, and discussion forums.
- **Online Module and Simulator**: As the project progresses, we will be adding the code for a front-facing web module and simulator. These tools will allow users to interact with and visualize the data and findings from the DESER project, determining a sites fitness for DESR instalatiion.
